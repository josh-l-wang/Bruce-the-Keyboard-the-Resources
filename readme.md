# Bruce the Keyboard (and friends)

This repository serves to document the changes and developments between the revisions as they have progressed, as well as to provide end-users with the necessary CAD files to make cases and plates as they see fit. To minimize confusion between the versions, resources for only the most recent versions are available here.

## Bruce the Keyboard
Bruce the Keyboard is a 34-key column staggered keyboard (not a human). The original layout was created by [whydobearsxplod](https://github.com/gleorepo). The original PCB was created by jlw (me) and debuted in 2024 with a small run of 15 PCBs.

- soldermask updated to black
- updated silkscreen
#### v2 (February 2024)
- added plate mount cutouts in 4 corners to allow for plate mount boards and plates

## Brian the Keyboard

Brian the Keyboard is a row stagger keyboard using the same keycap compatibility required for a Bruce the Keyboard (excepting one extra 1u for Brian the Keyboard). Brian the Keyboard the PCBs share the same edge cuts and mounting pattern as Bruce the Keyboard the PCB v2 and later (so cases are compatible with both Brian and Bruce PCBs.) Designed by [Noah Kiser](https://github.com/KiserDesigns).
